# hello-world
The Hello World project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming. It is a simple exercise that gets you started when learning something new. Letâ€™s get started with GitHub!

Hi, my name is DreElla. I am getting started with Github because I want to learn more about programming and its many languages. I figure the more the merier when
it comes to learning - so am ready to learn every language out there! I currently dabble in Python, HTML, CSS, and SASS. In the near future, I would like to learn
Java, Javascript, R, Swift, and more!
